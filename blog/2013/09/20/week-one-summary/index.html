<div class="entry-content"><p>The first week of the Fullstack course has come to a close;
taking the course is making me learn to use tools that I hadn&rsquo;t
gotten around to using before: Git, blogging tools, rspec.
We started the course with a basic exercise in HTML and CSS, building a personal website based on an image. Uploading our solutions to a unified repository became an interesting exercise in the use of Git. After that we reviewed (and completed) basic Ruby exercises from the pre-term assignment, but
the most interesting thing we did in the first week was probably setting up a blog on Octopress.</p>

<p>The recommended
format for composing blogs on Octopress is a simple markup language called Markdown, which is preprocessed into HTML. What&rsquo;s distinctive about Markdown is its simplicity and elegance:
the source file looks almost exactly like plain text and the formatting
commands are unobtrusive, yet it supports the most important
HTML elements to use in structuring text. I&rsquo;ve
used Markdown to reformat the private journal that will form the basis for this blog, and will continue to write in this format.</p>

<p>The
biggest challenge I&rsquo;ve experienced so far has been associated with the commute.
Before the course started I knew how to get to Fullstack by taking New Jersey Transit into Manhattan (Penn Station) and then taking the subway.
Riding New
Jersey Transit is generally pleasant&mdash;I sit down, get out my iPad,
and have time to watch web development tutorials from Team Treehouse.
In the middle of the week, however, I
decided to try the PATH train.  Three days ago I didn&rsquo;t even know
what the PATH train is, but on Tuesday morning I happened to be
looking out the window on the left side of the train when we stopped in Newark
Penn Station (can&rsquo;t they give the stations more distinctive names?);
and I saw that there were turnstiles leading to a light rail train labeled &ldquo;Port
Authority Trans Hudson&rdquo;, heading to the World Trade Center. I&rsquo;d been to New York
before and seen signs to PATH, but none of those signs had informed me that those signs lead to a train line to New Jersey.
It was by looking out the the window that,
absurdly late, I learned that there is a light rail from New
Jersey direct to downtown Manhattan.</p>

<p>That night, to try out the PATH train, I took the
subway to the Park Place stop where the signs and announcements
said &ldquo;connection is available to the PATH train&rdquo;, found the station,
and went down to the tracks.  The monitor there announced, &ldquo;Due to signal
problems, the trains between WTC and Newark in both directions are
subject to a 10 minute delay.&rdquo; I took the train to Newark, got out,
spent several minutes wandering through the train station (those
readers who are familiar with the station already know that this
reflects a serious mistake) until I found the track, just
after missing a train, and waited fifteen minutes for the next train.</p>

<p>Last night I tried the PATH train again. This time I walked to WTC,
and when I got there the monitors said, &ldquo;Due to a sick passenger,
the trains between WTC and Newark in both directions are subject
to a 10 minute delay.&rdquo;  The train I boarded had twenty minutes of
accumulated passengers, and was very full; the next one was already
on the track opposite, and was almost empty. After 25 minutes of being
squeezed like a sardine on that train, I got off and saw a corridor:
To Westbound Connecting Trains. It takes you straight to the platform
that I had taken so long to find two nights before! If I&rsquo;d seen it two nights before, I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed the train.
Getting back to my story, I didn&rsquo;t get on the first train, because it
was heading to Jersey Avenue and I didn&rsquo;t know where that was.
Instead, I waited for the first Northeast Corridor train to Trenton. Once I was on, I discovered I was on the wrong train: it was an express train, next stop Princeton Junction. I watched the train go past New Brunswick, go past Jersey Avenue (oh, that&rsquo;s where it is) and continue on. My wife decided to drive to Princeton to pick me up, and so I spent almost an hour at the station waiting for her. It was four hours after leaving Fullstack that I finally got home.</p>
