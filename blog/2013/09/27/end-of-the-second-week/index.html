<div class="entry-content"><p>Over the weekend I spent some time rethinking my typing technique based on David&rsquo;s
advice to remap the Caps Lock key to Control. It&rsquo;s definitely an
improvement. I&rsquo;m also reducing my need for the corners of the keyboard
by using Ctrl-H for Backspace, Ctrl-[ for Escape, Ctrl-J for Return, and
reassigning several keys away from the pinkies. Now 8 and 9 are assigned
to the right middle finger, 0 and &ndash; are on the ring finger, and P is on
the ring finger if it follows anything that uses the right pinky.
Both ring fingers are allowed to cross over the pinkies when the latter
are on the shift keys: Right-shift-(anything) followed by &ldquo;;&rdquo; or &ldquo;&lsquo;&rdquo; get the
ring finger for the second character; Left-shift-(anything) followed by
Ctrl-(anything right hand) gets the ring finger on the Control (formerly
Caps Lock) key. The general principle is not to let either pinky press
different keys on consecutive keystrokes. Command and Option are
assigned to the left thumb; those are the only keys assigned to it.</p>

<p>On Monday and Tuesday we wrote a blackjack-playing program and then got into SQL, working in pairs.
Learning SQL has been going much more smoothly this week than when I tried teaching myself last year.  I went through a group of complex SQL queries, developing fluency in SELECT statements, and have then started thinking about how to organize my Chinese vocabulary lists into a relational database.</p>

<p>Since
Brendan and I finished the Blackjack early, I spent the late morning of Tuesday working on keybinding macros for Sublime Text (so that I can reliably use Esc and Enter regardless of proposed completions popping up).  There are still peculiarities of that editor that I&rsquo;m having a hard time getting used to. For instance, on it like many other editors, Ctrl-H works like backspace. (Early computer terminals established this equivalence: the ASCII code for backspace is 8, the code for H is 72, and the control key of early keyboards caused a code to be sent mod 32. 72 mod 32 = 8.) However, the keys don&rsquo;t work exactly the same in Sublime: the editor doesn&rsquo;t seem to support mapping one key to another, so each key has to be mapped to each function separately. This makes for repetitive default keybinding files that are hard to update consistently, and as a result, there are inconsistencies: when you type a quotation mark, it automatically inserts a pair of them with the cursor in between, and when you then type Backspace, the pair disappears; but when you type Ctrl-H, only the one before the cursor disappears.  The Tab key also has some confusing behavior. It is normally bound to autocomplete words or insert snippets, but inside a Ruby string you can see a word completion, hit tab and get an HTML snippet instead.</p>

<p>Often, David uses Vim as his text editor in class, and Nimit uses TextMate.  I guess they recommended Sublime to us because it is one that both of them find usable, though it apparently has not become either one&rsquo;s favorite.</p>

<p>Wednesday and yesterday we spent time implementing a stripped-down version of ActiveRecord::Base, and then in the afternoon we made short presentations (TTL: &ldquo;Teach to learn&rdquo;) intended to help us gain clarity in our understanding of classes, objects and database tables, and to uncover any misconceptions we may have.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had generally positive with the commute this week; last night I had a pleasant walk to the World Trade Center, and made the connection from the PATH train to the NJTransit with no waiting. That, however was a matter of dumb luck.  Usually, when I come home after rush hour I have to wait a long time for the train and ride a slow local train. The later I stay, the longer my commute on average. Train schedules are encouraging me to leave early.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still working on my typing skill on the side. I&rsquo;ve decided that since I am embarking on the path to be a professional power user of computer keyboards, this is the time to take my typing skills to the next level. Last weekend, as mentioned before, I spent a lot of time practicing the efficient ergonomics of using a control key where the caps lock key normally is; I also spent time reading up on mechanical keyboards (ones with individual mechanical switches for the keys).  Monday night on my way home, I stopped at J&amp;R to get a feel for some. They had keyboards in stock with Cherry MX Blue switches (designed to make an audible click when they register the keystroke) and Cherry MX Red (smooth, no tactile or audible cues for when they&rsquo;ve registered). I found that the touch was
surprisingly light, and that the (useless) noise they make when keystrokes bottom out is much louder than the useful click when the keys register. They didn&rsquo;t have any keyboards with the brown switches (designed to be quiet but to feel like the blue switches.) I went home and ordered a refurbished keyboard with blue switches ($80) and a box of rubber O-rings to put under each key in order to dampen the noises.  Eighty dollars is definitely at the top of the price range that I&rsquo;m willing to pay for a computer keyboard, especially one that is not appropriate for work environments, but it seems to be the bottom end of the current market for mechanical keyboards. I could have bought a new instance of the same keyboard at J&amp;R for $130. The O-rings have not yet arrived, and without them the keyboard is definitely too loud.</p>
